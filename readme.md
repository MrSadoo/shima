# Dillinger

Due to [this post](https://jadi.net/2015/10/shima-bug/) by [Jadi](https://github.com/jadijadi) I wrote a little function to take care of the issue.

### Examples

```php
echo shima($name);
```

#### Thanks to

[Jadi](https://github.com/jadijadi) and [Mamal](https://github.com/mamal72) for teaching me new things everyday :)
